Based on your family's financial profile and your goals, here’s a tailored insurance plan that will provide you with adequate coverage against potential risks, ensuring financial stability for you and your dependents.

### 1. Health Insurance:
You currently have health insurance, which is vital. Ensure that your existing policy covers all family members adequately with a sufficient sum insured. Given the rising healthcare costs, consider increasing your coverage to at least ₹25,00,000. Review your policy for maternity benefits, critical illness coverage, and outpatient expenses to ensure comprehensive protection.

### 2. Life Insurance:
Since you currently do not have life insurance, it is strongly recommended to purchase term life insurance. Given your earning capacity and family dependency:
- **Recommended Coverage**: ₹1 crore per earning member.
- **Reason for this amount**: This provides a safety net for your family, ensuring they can maintain their lifestyle, manage debts, and plan for future goals even in your absence.
- **Recommended Product**: Look for a term insurance policy with a premium that fits your budget, ideally between ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 annually for each policy depending on health conditions and age.

### 3. Disability Insurance:
Disability insurance protects your income in case of unforeseen circumstances where you cannot work. Aim for a policy that covers at least 60% of your current income:
- **Recommended Coverage**: ₹60,000 per month (based on current salary).
- **Recommended Product**: Look into comprehensive disability plans offered by various insurers. The premium may vary but budgeting ₹1,000 to ₹3,000 per month would be prudent.

### 4. Property Insurance:
As you plan to purchase a house worth ₹1 crore in the next five years, it’s essential to plan for property insurance:
- **Recommended Coverage**: Full value of the house upon purchase (₹1 crore).
- **Recommended Product**: A comprehensive home insurance policy that covers structural damage, personal belongings, and natural disasters. The premium can generally range from ₹5,000 to ₹20,000 annually based on coverage.

### 5. Liability Insurance:
While you might not currently have liability insurance, consider getting personal liability coverage to protect against accidents on your property or damages caused inadvertently to others:
- **Recommended Coverage**: Around ₹50 lakhs should be adequate.
- **Recommended Product**: Look for liability coverage under your home insurance policy or a standalone personal liability insurance policy. Expect a premium in the range of ₹1,000 to ₹3,000 annually without extensive claims history.

### Summary of Recommendations:
- **Health Insurance**: ₹25 lakhs coverage, existing policy review.
- **Life Insurance**: ₹1 crore coverage per earning member, ₹5,000 - ₹10,000 annual premium.
- **Disability Insurance**: ₹60,000 monthly income coverage, ₹1,000 - ₹3,000 monthly premium.
- **Property Insurance**: ₹1 crore coverage upon purchase, ₹5,000 - ₹20,000 annual premium.
- **Liability Insurance**: ₹50 lakhs coverage, ₹1,000 - ₹3,000 annual premium.

### Next Steps:
1. Evaluate and adjust your existing health policy to enhance coverage.
2. Research and compare term life, disability, property, and liability insurance policies to choose the best ones considering premium affordability and benefits.
3. Initiate life and disability insurance policies as soon as feasible.
4. Monitor financial progress and review insurance coverage annually or upon life changes, such as buying a new property or changes in your family structure.

By implementing these recommendations, you will ensure a robust safety net for your family, secure your significant financial goals, and create a solid foundation against potential risks.
