- **Annual Savings:** ₹600,000 (₹50,000 x 12)

### Key Insights
- **Savings Rate:** The current savings of ₹50,000 per month equates to 50% of monthly income, which is excellent. This allows for substantial contributions toward financial goals.
- **Objective to Buy a Home:** To buy a house worth ₹1 crore in 5 years, savings required per month:  
    - Total needed = ₹1,00,00,000  
    - If we assume no appreciation and excluding any potential investment returns, monthly savings required = ₹1,00,00,000 / 60 months ≈ ₹1,666,667, which is not achievable with current savings.  
    - To make this feasible, considering the current savings of ₹50,000 will need to be adjusted or supplemented with additional income/investments over time.  
- **Children's Education Fund:** For ₹20 lakhs in 14 years:  
   - Monthly savings required = ₹20,00,000 / (14 years x 12 months) = ₹11,904, which is achievable with current savings.   
- **Retirement Fund Assumption:** To reach ₹4 crores in 25 years:  
   - Without additional investments, this equates to a monthly contribution of about ₹13,333—well within the current savings flexibility.  

### Investment Strategy
Given the moderate risk preference, investment avenues may include:
- **Equity Mutual Funds**: To achieve higher growth over long term  
- **Public Provident Fund (PPF)**: For tax benefits and guaranteed returns  
- **Fixed Deposits**: For safety and liquidity  
- **Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs)**: Focused on long-term goals while averaging out market risks  

### Insurance Recommendations
- **Consider Life Insurance**: To provide financial security in the event of an untimely death of a breadwinner.  
- **Property Insurance**: As house purchase progresses, insuring property is vital.  

### Assumptions Made
1. Debt repayment plans do not affect monthly savings significantly. 
2. Home purchase price remains constant over 5 years without inflation.
3. It is assumed the current monthly expenses will remain consistent over the planning horizon, with inflation increases not included.
4. Children’s education funds will not account for inflation or potential scholarship opportunities.

### Next Steps

2. Explore investment options to enhance return on savings for education and retirement.
3. Regularly monitor the financial situation, particularly the debt to income ratio, and make adjustments as necessary to stay on track to meet financial goals.
