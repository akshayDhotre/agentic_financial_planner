**Investment Strategy Overview**

To align with your financial goals of purchasing a house, funding children's education, and saving for retirement, I recommend a diversified strategy focused primarily on mutual funds and ETFs, with a preference for passive investment strategies. Below is a tailored investment strategy addressing each of your specific goals.

### 1. Goal: Buy a House (₹1 Crore in 5 Years)

**Current Situation**: You need to save approximately ₹1,666,667 per month to afford a house; however, your current savings of ₹50,000 per month will not suffice.

**Recommendation**:
- **Increase Monthly Savings**: Aim to set aside a greater portion of your monthly savings toward this goal, supplemented with investments.
- **Investment Approach**: Utilize a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in a mix of Equity Mutual Funds and ETFs. Given your moderate risk preference, consider a target allocation like:
  - **70% in an Equity Mutual Fund (SIP)**: For example, invest in a fund like Nippon India Digital India Fund or HDFC Index Fund - Sensex Plan which typically has a good track record.
  - **30% in a Liquid Fund**: For easier access to your funds within 3-5 years, such as ICICI Prudential Liquid Fund.

**Potential Growth**: If you invest ₹30,000/month in equity mutual funds with a growth assumption of 10% annual returns, you could accumulate about ₹22,00,000 over 5 years. Combined with your additional savings, this will help close the gap significantly.

### 2. Goal: Children’s Education (₹20 Lakhs in 14 Years)

**Current Situation**: You need ₹11,904/month, which is achievable with current savings.

**Recommendation**:
- **Investment Approach**: Invest ₹15,000/month through a SIP in a diversified Equity Mutual Fund such as Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund or SBI Nifty Index Fund.
- **Additional Savings**: Allocate the remaining savings toward the Public Provident Fund (PPF) for tax benefits and long-term security. 

**Potential Growth**: Assuming a conservative growth return of 10%, these investments could yield approximately ₹17,00,000 by the time your child is ready for college.

### 3. Goal: Retirement (₹4 Crores in 25 Years)

**Current Situation**: A monthly contribution of about ₹13,333 is well within your current capacity.

**Recommendation**:
- **Investment Approach**: Start a SIP of ₹20,000/month in a mix of Equity Mutual Funds and an Index Fund which follows the Nifty or Sensex for reliable growth. 
  - **Allocation**: 80% in Equity Mutual Funds and 20% in NPS (National Pension System) for additional tax benefits and compounding at a long-term horizon.

**Potential Growth**: With a target return of around 12% annually, this can potentially grow into over ₹6,00,00,000 due to the compounding effect over a long duration.

### Summary of Asset Allocation:
- **House Purchase**: ₹30,000/month in Equity Mutual Funds and ₹20,000 in a Liquid Fund.
- **Children's Education**: ₹15,000/month in Equity Mutual Funds and contribute ₹5,000/month to PPF.
- **Retirement**: ₹20,000/month in Equity Mutual Funds and NPS, focusing on a mix of growth-oriented funds.

### Insurance Recommendations
- **Secure Life Insurance**: It's crucial for protecting your family's financial future. Consider term insurance plans that offer coverage equal to 15-20 times your annual income.
- **Property Insurance**: Prioritize this as you approach the home purchase to mitigate risk.

### Assumptions Made
1. Debt repayment plans remain manageable and do not heavily impact monthly contributions.
2. House purchase pricing and living expenses remain stable over the next 5 years.
3. Monthly expenses remain consistent during this financial planning period, without major unforeseen increases.

### Next Steps
1. Adjust your budget to maximize the capacity for increased savings.
2. Continuously monitor your investments and progress towards your goals.
3. Review and rebalance your portfolio at least annually or when substantial changes occur in your life circumstances.

This comprehensive financial strategy aims to provide a robust framework for achieving your goals while being adaptable based on any potential financial changes. Regular reviews and adjustments will ensure you stay on track to meet your targets effectively.
